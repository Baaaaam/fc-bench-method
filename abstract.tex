This paper presents a new fuel cycle benchmarking analysis methodology
by coupling Gaussian process regression, a popular technique in Machine 
Learning, to dynamic time warping, a mechanism widely used in speech 
recognition. Together they generate figures-of-merit that are applicable to
any time series metric that a benchmark may study. The figures-of-merit
account for uncertainty in the metric itself, utilize information
across the whole time domain, and do not require that the simulators
use a common time grid. Here, a distance measure is defined that can be used 
to compare the performance of each simulator for a given metric. Additionally, 
a contribution measure is derived from the distance measure that can be used 
to rank order the importance of fuel cycle metrics. Lastly, this paper 
warns against using standard signal processing techniques for error reduction.
This is because it is found that error reduction is better handled by the 
Gaussian process regression itself.
